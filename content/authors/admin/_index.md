Christos Bergeles is Senior Lecturer (Tenured Assistant Professor) of Surgical Robotics at the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences of King's College London. His research interests include surgical robotics and interventional visual servoing. He leads the Robotics and Vision in Medicine Lab, which develops micro-surgical robotic systems and multi-sensory guidance algorithms to achieve impossible interventions deep inside the human body.

Christos received the Ph.D. degree in Robotics from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in 2011. He was a postdoctoral research fellow at Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts, and the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College, United Kingdom. Further, he was an Assistant Professor at the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences of University College London. Dr. Bergeles received the Fight for Sight Award in 2014, and the ERC Starting Grant in 2016.
