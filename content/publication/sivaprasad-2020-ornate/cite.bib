 abstract = {The ORNATE India project is funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) through the Global Challenges Research Fund. The aim is to build research capacity and capability in India and the UK to tackle global burden of diabetes-related visual impairment. As there are over 77 million people with diabetes in India, it is challenging to screen every person with diabetes annually for sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR). Therefore, alternate safe approaches need to be developed so that those at-risk of visual impairment due to DR is identified promptly and treated.},
