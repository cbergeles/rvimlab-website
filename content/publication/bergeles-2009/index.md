abstract: "Vitreoretinal surgeries require accuracy and dexterity that is often beyond the capabilities of human surgeons. Untethered robotic devices that can achieve the desired precision have been proposed, and localization information is required for their control. Since the interior of the human eye is externally observable, vision can be used for their localization. In this paper we examine the effects of the human eye optics on imaging and localizing intraocular devices. We propose a method for wide-angle intraocular imaging and localization. We demonstrate accurate localization with experiments in a model eye. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag."
